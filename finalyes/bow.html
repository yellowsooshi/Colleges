    <p>
      My wonderful Bowdoin, oh how you inspire me to write;</p>
    <p>I love the way you connect, give love, and might.</p>
    <p> Fluttering throughout my mind all day and night;</p>
    <p> Always dreaming about the possibilities we can create tonight.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Let me compare you to a polar bear;</p>
    <p>You are more snowy, joyful, and you care.</p>
    <p> Your curiosity brings my arms in the air;</p>
    <p> You are what makes Maine so rare!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Every restless day I wake to live in poverty,</p>
    <p> For my family cannot afford the necessity of living in quality.</p>
    <p> But soon, I will have many possibilities;</p>
    <p> For Bowdoin, you let hungry children live their odyssey!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      How do I love you? Let me count the ways.</p>
    <p> I love your vibrant dorms and communities that deserve praise.</p>
    <p> You allow pupils to amend the world for days;</p>
    <p> You have countless opportunities that leave me amazed!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The most beautiful word I know is your name, Bowdoin;</p>
    <p> Its sound gets my heart poundin'!</p>
    <p> Your kindness and creativity is immune to my melatonin;</p>
    <p> My love for you is explodin'!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      But Bowdoin, you make me cry;</p>
    <p> For I cannot wait for time to go by.</p>
    <p> Seminars with more harmony than a bonsai;</p>
    <p> Oh, Bowdoin, my love refuses to say goodbye!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I might not get this rhyme right, but it will be alright;</p>
    <p> Remember my lean words while we're apart on a winter night;</p>
    <p> As an eagle towards the sky take flight;</p>
    <p> I kiss your hand to say yes for the best four years of my life!
